# Color_sorting_and_size_sorting_machine_using_color-sensor_servo-motor_proximity-sensor_Arduino-Uno
Color sorting and Size sorting machine using Arduino UNO, SG90 Servo motor, TCS3200 Color sensor, E18D80NK Proximity sensor. 
Total Components: Servo motor(5x), Proximity sensor(1x), Color sensor(2x), Arduino UNO(1x) 
Expalination: There are two segments which represents the whole project. 
1. Size Sorting Segment: One proximity sensor (E18-D80NK) to detect the big objects by emitting IR rays. Two servo motors (SG90) allow or reject the objects to provide them their desired path plan after detecting the size.
2. Color Sorting Segment: Two color sensors (TCS3200) to detect the color of the objects. Three servo motors (SG90) allow or reject the objects to provide them with their desired path plan after detecting the color.
